# PFA_Housing_Project

Houses are one of the necessary need of each and every person around the globe and therefore housing and real estate 
market is one of the markets which is one of the major contributors in the world’s economy. It is a very large market 
and there are various companies working in the domain. Data science comes as a very important tool to solve problems 
in the domain to help the companies increase their overall revenue, profits, improving their marketing strategies and 
focusing on changing trends in house sales and purchases. Predictive modelling, Market mix modelling, 
recommendation systems are some of the machine learning techniques used for achieving the business goals for housing 
companies. Our problem is related to one such housing company.
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses 
data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price.
